## DESCRIPTION
This fuel consumption calculator is an application that will calculate the amount of fuel you would need to go a certain distance based on the fuel efficient average of the car’s CC. This would be integral for budgeting purposes for long trips or routes plied regularly and would give car-poolers the opportunity to decide cost-splitting beforehand. An additional advantage would be to track your vehicle’s fuel efficiency. Should one go significantly above the estimated price, they could proceed to make adjustments to ensure their vehicles are more fuel efficient. This calculator therefore solves the question on the cost and amount of fuel that is necessary for given distances.
